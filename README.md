Unit 04 Web APIs Homework: Code Quiz

Description:

MyTask

For this week's assignment I was asked to make a timed quiz using JavaScript Fundatmentals. I was asked to store the scores so that the person taking the quiz can compare their scores with their peers. In addition to providing some healthy competition, the ability to view one's scores can help the user see their improvements over time.
